Hey chuie,
Holy f*ck my internet is slow... I'm in a hotel in Venice and it's reallyyyyyyyy not working. Firewolf takes 2 million years to load.
The GitHub app returns an HTTP Get Failed error every time I try and sync changes.
I can't really work on anything relating to HTTP at all for the next few days. Have fun fixing everything!

Literally anything that requires internet is not working on my computer. Skype returns a timeout error, and chrome BARELY loads the pages.

Hey Nandos,
Wow you like literally read my mind. I just decided to work on Firewolf and I was thinking about copying other.lua over to another file
so I can work on the new menu. Thanks for doing that already for me :) Ok we'll use these notes, kinda like email via git XD

Hey chuie,
Read the note below this first.
I'm going to replace the experimental.lua with the contents of the other.lua (the latest version) so you can experiment with the menu bar thingy without destorying the other.lua. Have fun.

Hey chuie,
I think we need a way to message each other quickly and so we will read it before starting any new things on Firewolf, so I'm going to create this NOTES file where you can write eachother notes/messages. 
Before you start a note, just type - 1lann (like above), so we know who is writing what note.
Add new notes to the top of the file, so we can see them ordered.
