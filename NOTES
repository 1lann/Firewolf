Hey chuie,
Read the note below this first.
I'm going to replace the experimental.lua with the contents of the other.lua (the latest version) so you can experiment with the menu bar thingy without destorying the other.lua. Have fun.

Hey chuie,
I think we need a way to message each other quickly and so we will read it before starting any new things on Firewolf, so I'm going to create this NOTES file where you can write eachother notes/messages. 
Before you start a note, just type - 1lann (like above), so we know who is writing what note.
Add new notes to the top of the file, so we can see them ordered.
