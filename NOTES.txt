Hey chuie,
I noticed you released your menu thingy. I'll update the thread and pastebin links and stuffs. 
I fixed your prompt style (its [- word -] not [word]) and the indenting in your for loops (derp).
I also added a 10 second timeout for the GitHub verification. Not sure if this is enough?

Hey Nandos,
Wow you like literally read my mind. I just decided to work on Firewolf and I was thinking about copying other.lua over to another file
so I can work on the new menu. Thanks for doing that already for me :) Ok we'll use these notes, kinda like email via git XD

Hey chuie,
Read the note below this first.
I'm going to replace the experimental.lua with the contents of the other.lua (the latest version) so you can experiment with the menu bar thingy without destorying the other.lua. Have fun.

Hey chuie,
I think we need a way to message each other quickly and so we will read it before starting any new things on Firewolf, so I'm going to create this NOTES file where you can write eachother notes/messages. 
Before you start a note, just type - 1lann (like above), so we know who is writing what note.
Add new notes to the top of the file, so we can see them ordered.
